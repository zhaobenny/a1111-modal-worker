Anything in the `overwrite` directory will be copied/overwriten and baked into the Modal image.

Make sure the directory structure of the file is same.

eg. Adding the file `test.pt` to `\models\hypernetworks` in the remote A1111 instance will need the file path `\overwrite\models\hypernetworks\test.pt`
